University transportation management system
My project is the University Transport Management System (UTMS), which is designed to simplify and automate transportation services in a university. It helps manage tasks like issuing bus passes, scheduling routes, and tracking vehicles efficiently.

The system is built using Django for the backend, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the frontend, and a relational database like SQLite for storing data. It provides different user roles, such as:

Students/Staff: To book and track their transport.
Admins: To manage routes, vehicles, and bookings.
Drivers: To view and update their assigned routes.
This project replaces the manual processes, reducing errors and saving time, while also making the transport system more user-friendly and accessible. It addresses real-world challenges like overbooking and miscommunication, ensuring smooth operations.
